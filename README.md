# Project Name

--- JQuery Salary Calculator ---

This project challenges the aspiring software developer to integrate HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery into a cohesive, dynamic product that accepts user data and dynamically renders it to the DOM.

## Description

This app accepts five pieces of user input data to create new employee objects. It displays the employee object data in a dynamically rendered table, and keeps a running total at the bottom of the monthly expenditure of paying the salaries of all employees.
